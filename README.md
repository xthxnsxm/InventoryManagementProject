# InventoryManagementProject
Dear Ms. Manoil,
In order to use the application please create a new java project and create new 8 new classes each containing the code
that I have attached. The entire application should run off the class called "Main"
In addition to that, please include the nofrills.png and inventory.txt files that I have attached. You can also start with
your own blank inventory(the one I included is just an example)
Everything should be labeled for ease of use:
Enter Stock: (enter an item's name)
Amount: (Amount of said item)
Add:(Will add the item)
Subtract(Will subtract the item)
Remove(Will delete the item)
Back(Returns you to the main application page)

Features:
-Able to view stock
-Able to add new stock as well as add to existing stock
-Able to subtract items from existing stock
-Able to delete items from system
